    treatment_name: Dental cleaning (Dental Prophylaxis)
    treatment_description: Dental cleaning (Dental Prophylaxis) - A dental cleaning
      or prophylaxis is done every 6 months to clean hard and soft plaque off the
      surfaces of the teeth that have accumulated. Plaque that is left on the teeth
      over time can cause gum disease and eventual tooth loss. Thorough dental exams
      are done during this visit to detect any dental issues that need to be treated.

    treatment_name: Sealants
    treatment_description: Sealants are protective plastic shields that are placed
      into deep grooves of back teeth. Deep grooves in teeth have a tendency to trap
      debris and lead to decay. Sealants are placed in liquid form onto the teeth
      and then are cured to become solid so that they can protect the back teeth from
      decay.
