    treatment_name: Scaling and Root Planing
    treatment_description: Also called a deep cleaning, this treatment is performed
      to remove hardened plaque that has become attached to the tooth roots beneath
      the gumline. This plaque causes destruction of the bone and gum tissues that
      serve to hold teeth in place. When plaque begins to cause this destruction,
      the condition is called periodontal disease or gum disease. Left untreated,
      it results in tooth loss, chronic infection, and pain. Periodontal disease has
      also been linked to medical conditions and can predispose someone to develop
      serious medical problems.

    treatment_description: These trays are specially fabricated to deliver medication
      to the teeth and gum tissues which allow periodontal disease to be easier to
      control once treated with scaling and root planing. When used appropriately,
      Perio Protect tray therapy can reduce chair time during dental cleanings and
      even lengthen the time between needed periodontal maintenance visits.
