    treatment_name: Sleep Apnea Appliances
    treatment_description: Sleep apnea appliances are used as a medical treatment to treat sleep apnea. These appliances can be used as an alternative to other treatments for sleep apnea, such as surgery or using a CPAP. They can also be used in concert with CPAP therapy and surgery to control sleep apnea more completely. Sleep apnea appliances are made to fit inside the mouth and to position the jaw in a way that allows breathing to be more effective while sleeping. Sleep apnea appliances should only be made if prescribed by a medical doctor. Snoring appliances can be made to treat snoring if a medical doctor has determined a patient does not have sleep apnea.
